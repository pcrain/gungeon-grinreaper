The Grin Reaper will spawn in the first room of the first floor, offering a random powerful (i.e., S Quality) gun or item in exchange for a random sacrifice. Each sacrifice will significantly handicap the player, as such is the price that must be paid for good items early. Items will be drawn from global loot tables and should include all vanilla and modded S quality items. The currently implemented sacrifices and their effects are as follows:

| Sacrifice   | Effects |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| brain       | remove most UI information |
| eyes        | lower shot accuracy & enemy visibility |
| arms        | damage, reload speed, & fire rate down |
| legs        | movement speed down |
| fingers     | chance to drop gun upon firing |
| heart       | lose most of your health & armor |
| lungs       | dodge rolls require rest |
| stomach     | no healing from health & armor |

Enjoy! :D
